Git is used for version  control.
With git, we can clone or initialize a git repo locally.
From there you can add, pull and push.
Also,we can create breanches for developing new features.
Rebase and Merge all comine all the work on a branch to the master.
Also, rebase helps deal with conflicts to a degreee.
We aslo have the 3Rs being: Restore, Reset and Revert.
We create a stash and switch to another branch without losing modifications
on the current branch.
Finally, we always create pull requests to merge a forked repo to the 
primary repo.
